1. Geographic Distribution: Analysis by region, state, and city to identify high-performing and underperforming markets.
2. Vehicle Classification: Comparative performance of EV (Electric Vehicles) vs Non-EV models to assess emerging trends and future profitability.
3. Fuel Type Analysis: Segmentation across petrol, diesel, hybrid, and EV to understand consumer preferences and operational margins.
4. Brand Preferences: Evaluation of customer purchasing behavior across major luxury brands including Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Porsche, and Lexus.
5. Profitability Segmentation: Detailed breakdown of profit margins between EV and Non-EV categories.
6. Lead-to-Test Drive Conversion Correlation: Statistical correlation analysis to measure the effectiveness of lead generation campaigns and their impact on actual test drives.
This project leveraged data-driven methodologies to support strategic decision-making, enhance customer targeting, and optimize sales performance across the luxury car segment.
